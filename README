The way these sockets work depend on the type of socket chosen. And flow of messages being sent depend on the chosen patterns, of which there are four:

Request/Reply Pattern: Used for sending a request and receiving subsequent replies for each one sent.
Publish/Subscribe Pattern: Used for distributing data from a single process (e.g. publisher) to multiple recipients (e.g. subscribers).
Pipeline Pattern: Used for distributing data to connected nodes.
Exclusive Pair Pattern: Used for connecting two peers together, forming a pair.


ZeroMQ Transport Types
ZeroMQ offers four different types of transport for communication. These are:

In-Process (INPROC): Local (in-process) communication transport.
Inter-Process (IPC): Local (inter-process) communication transport.
TCP: Unicast communication transport using TCP.
PGM: Multicast communication transport using PGM.
